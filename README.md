# Project_3: Understanding Covid-19 Variants in European Countries

**Overview and Purpose**

We have choose 6 European countries and trying to see how emergence and concentration of Covid-19 variants varied over time.


**Key Objectives:**

1. Data Exploration: Dive into Novel COVID19 API to find change of variants over time in six different European Countries.

2. Analysis: Identify top 3 variants in differnt countries and their detections

3. 

4. Impact and need of Variants: With Study of variants, it helps in developing vaccinations, controlling the disesase, and making stratgies to overcome to affect of disease.
